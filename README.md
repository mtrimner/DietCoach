# DietCoach

Welcome to this DietCoach. This is my first project using ruby on rails. The goal of this project was to learn the ins and outs of ruby on rails including where it excels and what its limitations are. The app is an automated diet coach. The user enters in the requested information and the application will calculate the exact macronutrients ratios and calories needed to hit the goal weight by the goal date. Many planned features were unable to be added because they required javascript and the purpose of this project was to learn and use rails exclusively. This was done as an assignment for Flatiron School. A new version of this app will be made utilizing javascript in the near future.
